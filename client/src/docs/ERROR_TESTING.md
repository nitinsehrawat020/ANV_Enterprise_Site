# Error Handling Test Instructions

## 🧪 Testing the Error Boundary and 404 Page

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure the development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. The server should be accessible at: `http://localhost:5174/`

### Test 1: 404 Page with Navigation

1. **Visit an invalid URL**: `http://localhost:5174/invalid-page-url`
2. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Should show 404 page with navigation bar
   - ✅ Should have "Go Back" and "Go Home" buttons
   - ✅ Should show popular page links
   - ✅ Navigation should work (home, about, etc.)

### Test 2: Error Test Component (Development Only)

1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:5174/error-test`
2. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Should show error test page with navigation
   - ✅ Should have 3 buttons: Test Button, Sync Error, Async Error

### Test 3: Button Functionality

1. **Click "🧪 Test Button"**:
   - ✅ Should increment counter
   - ✅ Should log to console: "✅ Test button clicked! Count: X"

### Test 4: Sync Error Testing (Error Boundary)

1. **Click "🔥 Trigger Sync Error"**:
   - ✅ Should immediately show Error Boundary page
   - ✅ Should display error message about test error
   - ✅ Should have "Refresh Page" and "Go to Home" buttons
   - ✅ Should work in development mode (show error details)

### Test 5: Error Recovery

1. **From Error Boundary page**:
   - **Click "Refresh Page"**: ✅ Should reload and return to error test page
   - **Click "Go to Home"**: ✅ Should navigate to home page

### Test 6: Async Error Testing (Console/Alert)

1. **Click "⚡ Trigger Async Error"**:
   - ✅ Should show countdown: "⏱️ Async Error in 3s", "2s", "1s"
   - ✅ After countdown: Should show alert popup
   - ✅ Should log error to console
   - ✅ Should NOT be caught by Error Boundary (React limitation)

### Test 7: Navigation Integration

1. **From any error page**:
   - ✅ Navigation menu should work
   - ✅ Footer should be present
   - ✅ Layout should be consistent with other pages

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If buttons are not working:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the Button component is receiving onClick props
3. Make sure the development server is running without errors

If 404 page doesn't show navigation:

1. Check that the route is wrapped with UserAppLayout
2. Verify the NotFound component uses the Main styled component

If Error Boundary doesn't catch errors:

1. Make sure the error is synchronous (async errors won't be caught)
2. Check that ErrorBoundary is properly wrapping the component tree
3. Verify error logging in browser console

## 📝 Console Output to Look For

When testing, you should see these console messages:

- `✅ Test button clicked! Count: X` (for test button)
- `🔥 Triggering sync error...` (before error boundary triggers)
- `⚡ Starting async error countdown...` (for async error)
- `⏱️ Countdown: X` (during countdown)
- `🚨 Async Error: This error won't be caught by Error Boundary!` (async error)

## ✅ Success Criteria

All error handling is working if:

1. ✅ 404 page has navigation and proper layout
2. ✅ Error test buttons respond to clicks
3. ✅ Sync errors are caught by Error Boundary
4. ✅ Error recovery options work (refresh, go home)
5. ✅ Async errors show alert (demonstrating limitation)
6. ✅ Navigation works from all error pages
